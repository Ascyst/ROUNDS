## Features 
------------------------
## **Remove Shakes**
Enabling this in the ingame GUI (accessed via F1) will disable any screen shakes you would normally experience in game. 
Disabling the field will return your shake levels to normal. 
## **Remove Chromatic Aberration (Rainbows)**
Enabling this in the ingame GUI (accessed via F1) will disable any chromatic aberration ingame. 
This effect is most visible when bullets with a massive damage amount make contact with a player/wall.
Disabling the field will return your chromatic aberration to normal. 
## **Remove colored ground (decent FPS boost)**
Enabling this in the ingame GUI (accessed via F1) will remove the color and style from the ground and walls. This seems to improve FPS on lower end systems.
Disabling the field will return your ground to normal. 
## **Remove the glow effect around players. Also removes the pesky gun visual (overrated)**
Enabling this in the ingame GUI (accessed via F1) will remove the glow effect around your character (most noticeable with colored ground turned off). This also removes the gun from players, unfortunately. 
Disabling the field will return your players glowiness to normal.  
## **Remove the light from the top of the map, and the shadows it causes**
Enabling this in the ingame GUI (accessed via F1) will remove the light from the game. 
Disabling the field will return the game to it's original lightness.
